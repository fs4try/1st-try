								In the 2020 census, it had a population of 9,517 people. Basco is located on Batan

								missionaries and officials of the Spanish government who started the civilization and Christianization 
								of Batanes. The history of Basco began with the arrival of sea-rowing Malays in the area. They set up settlements in

							Batanes was a sub-province of Cagayan with Basco as the capital town. The town is named after Capitán
							General José Basco, who led the pacification and conquest of the islands during his term as Governor-General.
							In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which seeks Basco
							including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities or
							highly urbanized cities to automatically convert into cities. The municipality has a land area of 49.46
							square kilometres (19.10 sq mi) constituting 22.58% of the 219.01-square-kilometre- (84.56 sq mi) total area
							of Batanes. Basco is politically subdivided into 6 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have
							sitios. The sitio of Diptan was converted into a barrio, known as San Antonio, in 1955. Also in the same
							year, the sitios of Coral, Hago, Tuva, Diojango, Canalaan, Honaan and Dimnalamay were converted into the
							barrio of San Joaquin. Basco has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification Am). Compared
							to cities down south such as Laoag or Manila, it has a slightly cooler temperatures especially during the
							winter months due to its northerly location. According to the 2015 Census, the age group with the highest population in Basco is 10 to 14, with

							Basco Lighthouse is a lighthouse in the town of Basco in Batanes, the northernmost province in the 
							Philippines. Located in Naidi Hills in Barangay San Antonio, the lush green hills and the open sea 
							provide a beautiful backdrop for the lighthouse. The place can easily be reached by a 1.2-km hike 
							from the Port of Basco. Basco Lighthouse is one of the three lighthouses proposed by former 
 							Congressman Florencio Abad of Batanes, not only as working lighthouses, but possibly as tourist 
							attractions. The other two are in Sabtang and Mahatao. The Basco structure was the first completed 
							in 2003. The location chosen is where the first lighthouse of Basco was built.

							buildings survived and some have been converted into businesses like a café - resulting from the 
							area becoming popular because of the lighthouse. The structure is a 6-story building with a gallery

					<div class="bb">
						<img class="infimg" src="vbb.jpg">					
						<p class="inftxt" style="margin-left: 40px;"> 
							The Valugan Boulder Beach is a three-kilometer beach located along the coast of Batan Island.
							As its name suggests, the beach's shore is made up of different-sized boulders that help create 
							an incredible landscape framed by almost vertical cliffs and rolling hills. The boulders here were
							said to have been coughed out from the guts of by Mt. Iraya, a nearby active volcano. What used to
							be rough andesite rocks were slowly polished by the tides and the restless waves over. From the beach,
							only the loud whistling of the wind and constant rumbling of the Pacific can be heard as the waves 
							come slapping the shore. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="inftxt2">
							Surprisingly, the beach makes for a relaxing setting especially during sunrise. While it is a beach,
							swimming is not allowed due to the area's rough terrain. Bringing home any stones from the beach is 
							also prohibited. It is best to visit this beach in the dry or summer season, which usually starts in
							March and ends in the latter weeks of May. There are smaller chances of rainfall as well during these
							months, so you can better enjoy the view from the beach. The beach is known for its smooth boulders that
							line the shoreline, which stretches for miles. Unlike most pebble beaches, the pebbles on Valugan—aptly
							called boulders—are enormous in size. The boulders are said to have originated from Mount Iraya, a nearby
							active volcano. It’s a masterpiece created by the elements. In 400 AD, Mt. Iraya erupted and scattered 
							andesite rocks around the northern half of Batan, which is now Basco, from the fiery guts of the earth.
							The Pacific’s mighty winds pushed the waves to lap the rough rocks, polishing it in the process.
							The result: a boulder beach that we now call Valugan. Valugan means “east” in the Ivatan language.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="bb">
						<p class="inftxt" style="position: relative; top: -15;">
							Boulders fill the jagged eastern edge of Batan Island like marbles recklessly dumped in a corner. The 
							elements here are at war. The wind is whistling, the sea slapping the shore, and sharp cliffs breaking 
							the tides. Yet, there is something so trance-inducing about the whole action. Like the ironically named 
							ocean it faces, Valugan Beach is absolutely pacifying. Valugan Beach was the first stop on my first day
							in Batanes, an unforgettable welcome. I stood on one of the boulders and watched the fierce waves sweep 
							the sea. Every now and then, a splash of water shot toward me, and I would immediately hide the camera 
							under my shirt. The sun was just as harsh at that time as the tour started a little later than usual.
						</p>
						<img class="infimg" src="vbb2.jpg" style="margin-left: 40px;">
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="inftxt2" style="height: 60px;">
							Going around the beach is difficult and a bit risky, but bordering the strip of boulders are much more 
							sole-friendly carpets of grass. A trail southward leads to a bend with small pebbles, not boulders. The
							waves are also less violent in this part, albeit still not recommended for swimming.

							Mount Iraya, is a dormant stratovolcano on Batan Island and the highest point in the province  
							of Batanes, Philippines.
							Mount Iraya is one of two volcanoes located on Batan Island in the province of Batanes. It is 
							also the highest point in Batanes, with an elevation of 1,009 meters, and the northernmost 
							active volcano in the country. It last erupted back in 1454. Mount Iraya is a landmark of

							Batanes Islands, in the province of Batanes, in the Luzon Strait, north of the island of Luzon,
							in the Philippines.It is the northernmost active volcano in the Philippines.

							Iraya is a heavily forested stratovolcano, with an elevation of 1,009 metres (3,310 ft) asl,
							and a base diameter of 5,500 metres (18,000 ft). Adjacent volcanic edifice is Mount Matarem.
							Mount Iraya last erupted in 1454, and the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology 
							(PHIVOLCS) considers it as one of the active volcanoes in the Philippines. In 1998, volcanologists
							recorded seismic swarms which led them to form a monitoring network on Batan Island for several 
							months. After the swarms of tremors had diminished, the temporary stations in Barangay San Joaquin
							in Basco, Batanes and another near the crater, were pulled out. Seismicity or any activity relating
							to Iraya is still monitored by the Basco Seismological Station. Mount Iraya is a sacred mountain
							for the Ivatan people. There are two contrasting tales regarding the mountain, the first tale states
							that the mountain is a mother overlooking her children (the Ivatans) for their protection, while the
							second tale states that if a ring of clouds appear on top of the mountain, Iraya is notifying the 
							people for preparation due to an inevitable death of an elder, usually due to natural causes.

							The Japanese Dipnaysupuan Tunnel is an underwater tunnel network in the Philippines, Tukon Hills,
							Basque Country. During the Japanese occupancy of the Philippines until World War II, it served as a
							shelter for the imperial Japanese forces. The Japanese imperial forces forced the Ivatans, due to 
							their strategic position, to dig tunnels for refuge at Tukon Hills. In these tunnels, the Japanese
							soldiers hid for years before the end of World War II. Bring a torchlight into the tunnels in 
							Dipnaysupuan to see the 4 rooms, a bunker, a guard posting, and a hollow serving as a reservoir of 
							water. Also, wear good headgear inside when available to prevent rocks from hitting. 							
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="inftxt2">
							There is a long descent to the tunnels such that sneakers or climbing sandals are best worn if 
							possible. Most chambers were feeling a bit bleak. A tricycle trip from Basco town to Dipnaysupuan
							Japanese Tunnel is the quickest route. It is also highly recommended to join a Batanes guided tour
							that includes this tourist spot for a more convenient trip. This is an all-year-round destination
							and is open from 8 AM to 4 PM. The Japanese tunnel was created back in World War II era supposedly
							by Filipino prisoners of war. The purpose of the tunnel was to be a hideout not only for soldiers
							but also their belongings. It has been said that many tunnels were actually dug back then during or
							soon after the United States took over Davao City. From 1941 to 1945, the soldiers ordered the 
							Ivatans to dig the tunnel, creating five exit points, chambers, bunkers, and water reservoir. The
							bunker served as their lookout spot while in battle with the Americans. The tunnel, meanwhile, is
							250-meter long and has a lower deck chamber. Inside, you’ll find nothing but rocks, small holes, and
							shattered tunnel walls. Some entrance points have cement above to protect the tunnel from the 
							bombings during the war. Dipnaysupuan served as a camp and shelter of Japanese troops who were 
							fighting in the strategically important Batanes islands during their occupation of the Philippines.

							Mt. Carmel Chapel, also known as Tukon Church, was first established on May 3, 2008, at Sitio
							Tukon, Barangay Chanarian, Batanes. It adopted the design of a traditional Ivatan house made
							of stone walls, making it the only chapel embodying such design.
							Mt. Carmel Chapel also manifests solemnity and tranquility as it perfectly sits on top of a
							hill, overlooking the lush greenery of Batanes, as well as the Pacific Ocean and the West 
							Philippine Sea. The Abads are the most prominent and the most powerful family in Batanes.

							construction of the church that it also becomes a showcase of the building tradition and 
							creative talent of the locals. Local craftsmen, masons and carpenters built the church, whose 
							design is inspired by the traditional Ivatan stone houses . Architects Joven Ignacio and Tina
							Turralba helped complete the design. Covering
							the ceiling are large images of the patron saints standing in front of the churches of the six 
							municipalities of Batanes, painted by scholars of the Pacita Abad Center for the Arts. The
							stained glass windows and the hardwood pews are contributions from the Abads’ friends and family.
							he church was officially opened on 3 May 2008, in time for the wedding of Rep. Abad’s daughter 
							Julia, who is also the  Presidential Chief of Staff, married Englishman Andrew Parker. Tukon 
							Chapel sits humbly atop a foothill, an eye-catcher made of stone as though offered by the 
							greenery to the restless skies. Tukon means “mountain” in the Ivatan language, an apt name as it
							covers generally rugged terrain that lies in the shadow of Mt. Iraya. From here, one can admire
							the mischievous waves of both the West Philippine Sea and the roaring Pacific. Under the
